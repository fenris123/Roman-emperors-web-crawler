With this Python program you insert the wikipedia page of a roman emperor, and it will automatically retrieve a list with the succesors

You must insert the wikipedia page and how many sucessors do you want to know.
The number of generations must be inserted using numbers, not text.

The program requires the beautifull soup library.  You must install it if it's not installed.

Of course, you can try it with other emperors.  Just remember to use the spanish version of wikipedia.

KNOWN ISSUES:

The roman emperor Teodosio I splited the empire in two. The program will continue with the roman emperors of the oriental roman empire.

The (oriental) Roman Emperor Zenon was deposed by Basilisco and reinstated after that: This create a loop in the program.  
It will not crash. It just count every loop as an adittional generation and stop when it achieves the selected number of generations.

Perhaps you want to adapt it to the english version of wikipedia?  
Solve the loop problem?
Modify it to look for the western roman empires?
Trying it with other empires or kingdoms?

Well... just do it!
